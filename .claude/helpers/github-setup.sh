# Security rationale: set -euo pipefail ensures that:
#   -e  — exit immediately if any command fails (no silent failures)
#   -u  — treat unset variables as errors (prevents empty-string expansion bugs)
#   -o pipefail — pipeline fails if any command in it fails (not just last)
# This matches the ADR-127 Phase 2 requirement for github-setup.sh hardening.
